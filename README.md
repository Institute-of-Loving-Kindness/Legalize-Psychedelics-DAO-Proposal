# Subject: Grant Proposal for Legalize Psychedelic Medicine DAO

Dear Public Nouns,

Iâ€™m Matthew Weintrub. I am one of the leaders of the Psychedelic Movement in the United States. I have helped enact policy change at the state and federal level. Please see previous press articles, wins and partner orgs at [Legalize Network](https://legalize.network/).

I am writing to submit a grant proposal on behalf of the Legalize Psychedelic Medicine DAO. We are seeking funding to support our organization's efforts in gaining support for the [Heal America Act](https://healamerica.xyz/), which aims to enact Federal policy change around psychedelics in order to address and end the mental health crisis plaguing our nation.

### 1. Executive Summary:
The Legalize Psychedelic Medicine DAO is a grassroots organization committed to promoting access to safe and effective psychedelic medicines for therapeutic purposes. We firmly believe that a paradigm shift in mental health treatment is long overdue, and that psychedelics hold significant promise as a groundbreaking tool for healing and transformation.

The Heal America Act, to be developed in collaboration with leading experts, researchers, and advocates, will be the first attempt at open-source decentralized policy making. See the [rough draft outline on github](https://github.com/Institute-of-Loving-Kindness/Right-to-Heal-Act). This act represents a comprehensive and evidence-based framework for integrating psychedelic medicine into mainstream healthcare. By legalizing and regulating the therapeutic use of psychedelics, this legislation will provide a much-needed solution to the ongoing mental health crisis in America.

### 2. Background and Problem Statement:
The mental health crisis in the United States has reached alarming proportions. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly one in five adults in the U.S. experiences mental illness each year, with rates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD skyrocketing in recent years. Traditional treatments often fall short, leaving many individuals without effective options for recovery.

Psychedelic-assisted therapy has shown remarkable potential in clinical trials and real-world settings. Studies have demonstrated significant improvements in treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, addiction, and end-of-life anxiety. However, outdated regulations and societal stigma hinder access to these transformative therapies, preventing millions from benefiting.

See our [State of the Crisis](https://legalize.network/state-of-the-mental-health-crisis) statistics report. 

### 3. Objectives:
The Legalize Psychedelic Medicine DAO aims to achieve the following objectives:

a) Raise awareness and educate the public, policymakers, and healthcare professionals about the therapeutic potential of psychedelics.
b) Advocate for the inclusion of psychedelics in evidence-based treatment protocols.
c) Mobilize grassroots support to push for the passage of the Heal America Act.
d) Expand sister organizations into other western democracies to advocate for the same policy reform
d) Collaborate with researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies to develop guidelines and best practices for psychedelic therapy.

### 4. Proposed Activities:
To achieve our objectives, we have designed a multifaceted approach that includes:

a) Educational Campaigns: We will develop informative materials, organize public lectures, and host webinars to educate key stakeholders about the scientific evidence supporting psychedelic medicine and its potential to alleviate the mental health crisis.

b) Advocacy and Lobbying: Our organization will engage with policymakers at the local, state, and federal levels to advocate for legislative reforms that align with the principles of the Heal America Act. We will also collaborate with like-minded organizations to amplify our collective impact.

c) Grassroots Mobilization: We will establish a network of volunteers and activists who will engage in grassroots advocacy efforts, including letter-writing campaigns, public demonstrations, and community outreach to gain public support for the Heal America Act.

d) Collaboration and Research: We will partner with researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies to develop evidence-based guidelines and best practices for psychedelic therapy. This collaboration will ensure the safe and responsible integration of psychedelics into mainstream healthcare.

### 5. Budget & Roadmap

**We are requesting a grant of 5.5ETH to support our activities over the course of 90 days. The budget will be allocated as follows:**

#### Phase 1: Prepare for NFT Launch

- Merchandise Development

#### Phase 2: NFT Marketing

#### Phase 3: Post-Mind Budget Allocation 

In an ideal scenario we would raise $600,000 to fund year 1 of the organization. Here is a detailed breakdown of the budget.

### 6. Is this a Public Good?

Hell yes. The Legalize Psychedelic Medicine DAO is a public good because it serves the broader interests and well-being of society as a whole. Here are several ways in which the DAO contributes to the public good:

1) Mental Health Crisis: The DAO addresses the widespread mental health crisis by advocating for the legalization of psychedelic medicine, providing innovative and effective solutions to improve mental health outcomes.
2) Evidence-Based Medicine: The DAO promotes evidence-based practices and policies for the responsible use of psychedelics in therapy, collaborating with experts to develop guidelines and best practices.
3) Social Justice and Equity: The DAO advocates for policy reform to address the unjust criminalization and stigmatization of psychedelics, striving for equitable access to therapy for all individuals.
4) Economic Benefits: Legalizing psychedelic medicine creates economic opportunities through regulated industries, generating jobs and contributing to local and national economies.
5) Public Health and Harm Reduction: The DAO supports the integration of psychedelic therapy within healthcare systems, promoting public health and harm reduction strategies for safer use.

### 7. Is this Legal to fund?

Yes. By creating a 501(c)(3) organization that can raise unlimited funds for this cause the organization can then lend said fund to the 501(c)(4) for operations. Unlike grant funds, a 501(c)(4) may use a 501(c)(3) loan for general support or fundraising and its use does not count against the 501(c)(3)'s lobbying limits.
